## This is an example of a Component Page

It is similar to the other pages in that you can use Markdown/MDX, but it expects to find your component documentation in the `/components` directory (although you can change that in your `gatsby-config.js` file by setting the `componentLibPath`). There is also support for showing components from a Storybook build. By default it is set to pull from the default Storybook build path (`/storybook/iframe.html`), but that is configurable in `gatsby-config.js` by setting `UILibPath`.

The `id` for your component is the ID that Storybook uses to identify the component in their iframe, which is `COMPONENT_DIRECTORY--COMPONTENT_NAME` (you can find this in the Storybook URL). There is also a height prop that you can configure to increase the height of the iframe. The example button below uses the following code:

```
<StorybookComponent id="button--example" height="75px" />
```

<StorybookComponent id="button--example" height="75px" />

<TabLinks defaultTab="React">
  <a href="http://example.com/vanillajs" target="_blank">Vanilla JS</a>
  <a href="http://example.com/angular" target="_blank">Angular</a>
</TabLinks>

```html
<Button>Click Here</Button>
```
