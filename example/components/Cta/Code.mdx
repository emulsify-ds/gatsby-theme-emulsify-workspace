## This is a CTA Component

Notice that there are tabs at the top of the component pages. Those are added using a couple of fields in the front matter like so:

```html
tab: "Code"
tabOrder: 1
```

"Tab" is the name of the tab and tabOrder controls where it falls in the order of the tabs.

## CTA Component

<StorybookComponent id="cta--example" height="240px" />

Note: You can lay out components however you like including content around or below them and between your component and code.
